--- Summary ---

This demonstration program draws illustrations of the B+ trees constructed by
the STX B+ Tree template classes. The demo allows the user to selected
different types of B+ tree instantiations: integer or string keys and different
slot numbers. The user may insert and erase key/data pairs from the tree and
run different search operations. The demo program uses the cross-platform
wxWidgets toolkit and can be compiled on Linux, Windows and MacOSX.

--- Program Usage ---

The easiest way to see how the demo functions is by pressing "Insert Random"
and selecting 20 pairs from the popup menu. These random number pairs are then
shown in the B+ tree illustration.

The operation buttons perform their respective functions on the B+ tree with
the key/data input given in the two edit fields. The operation's result is
printed into the text line below the buttons.

The B+ tree drawing can be scrolled using the scrollbars and zoomed using the
mouse wheel (on Windows this requires the drawing to be activated by a click).
