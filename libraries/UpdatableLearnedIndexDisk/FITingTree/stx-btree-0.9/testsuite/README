--- Summary ---

This directory contains a set of tests to check the B+ tree implementation for
bugs. It can be compiled using the usual configure / "make all check" sequence
from the top source directory.

Additionally one can use "configure --enable-gcov" followed by "make run-gcov"
to generate a converage report for the test suite.

The report is also available online at
